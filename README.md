# 🐇 Mad Rabbits Riot Club

Mad Rabbits Riot Club is a project by DeFi Society Studios x pr0xy, originally launched in 2021 and taking just 7 minutes to sell out, it was one of the most ambitious projects of its time. MRRC continues these ambitions through Gang Wars, a secondary collection featuring over one-thousand traits spread across a number of "factions".
